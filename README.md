What are Package Managers ??
Package managers for JavaScript are tools that automate the process of installing, updating, configuring, and managing dependencies (i.e., other libraries and frameworks) that a JavaScript project requires. Package managers make it easy to reuse code and avoid writing the same code over and over again, saving time and effort for developers.

The two most commonly used package managers for JavaScript are:

npm (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager for Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. npm is widely used and has a large community of contributors, making it easy to find and use a wide range of packages for your project.

Yarn: Yarn is a newer package manager for JavaScript that was developed by Facebook. It was designed to address some of the shortcomings of npm, such as slow installation times and dependency conflicts.
